# MoodMusic 🎶

MoodMusic is a music recommendation app that generates playlists based on your **mood** and **language preference**. Instead of searching by artist or genre, you simply pick how you feel (or want to feel), and MoodMusic translates that into music recommendations using the **Spotify API**.
