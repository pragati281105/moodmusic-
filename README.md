# Mood Music in Git Commit Messages

## What is "Mood Music"?

"Mood music" is a creative, informal line in a Git commit message that sets the **tone** for the changes you've made. It's a way to add personality and context to your code that goes beyond a dry technical summary.

Think of it as the **soundtrack to your code changes**:

* Fixed a frustrating bug? â†’ Victory anthem.
* Refactored messy code? â†’ Chill-out track.
* Added a big feature? â†’ Energetic, uplifting tune.
